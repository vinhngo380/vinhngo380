### Hi, this is Vinh Ngo.

I am a student currently studying Computer Science at Penn State University! 

I'm interested in embedded systems and systems programming, currently in Penn State's Advanced Vehicle Team (AVT). <br>
This page will be uploading projects related to embedded and systems programming that I'll be doing in my freetime (eg; my c-collection repo)

I also try to work on smaller things, like making an addon to display statistics within Anki. (whenver I can find the time that is...)

Some of my hobbies is learning Japanese (永遠に日本語上手）and playing video games! <br>
