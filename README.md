### Hi, this is Vinh Ngo.

I am a student currently studying Computer Science at Penn State University! 

I'm interested in embedded systems and systems programming, currently in Penn State's Advanced Vehicle Team (AVT)
This page will be uploading projects related to embedded and systems programming that I'll be doing in my freetime (eg; my c-collection repo)

Other things I've worked on/some of my hobbies is learning Japanese! I'm working on making an addon to display statistics within Anki. (whenver I can find the time that is!)
