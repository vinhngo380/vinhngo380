### Hi, this is Vinh Ngo.

I am a student currently studying Computer Science at Penn State University! 

ðŸ”­I want to work on many projects, but currently I am working on an automatic file mover. 
Eventually, I want to learn to use APIs, front-end/web developement, games, etc, in some real world cases so I hope that you see those soon!
